Subject: [PATCH] Fix connect/sendto/sendmsg into ignoring bytes beyond sockaddr length

Thanks Tanaka Akira for the report.

* sysdeps/mach/hurd/connect.c: Include <string.h>
(__connect): Duplicate ADDR->sun_path with sockaddr length limitation before
looking up the file name.
* sysdeps/mach/hurd/sendmsg.c: Likewise.
* sysdeps/mach/hurd/sendto.c: Likewise.
* sysdeps/mach/hurd/bind.c: Call strndupa instead of implementing it by hand.
