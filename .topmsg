Subject: Fix Hurd implementation of setitimer.

    The preemptor sigcode doesn't match since the POSIX sigcode SI_TIMER is
    used when SIGALRM is sent. In addition, The inline version of
    hurd_preempt_signals doesn't update _hurdsig_preempted_set. For these
    reasons, the preemptor would be skipped by post_signal.
    
    * sysdeps/mach/hurd/setitimer.c (setitimer_locked): Fix preemptor setup.
