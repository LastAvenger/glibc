Subject: [WIP] [PATCH] Fix lockf64 support

struct flock64 uses 64bit values.  This introduces other values for F_GETLK,
F_SETLK, F_SETLKW to distinguish between both.

* sysdeps/mach/hurd/bits/fcntl.h (F_GETLK64, F_SETLK64, F_SETLKW64): New macros
[__USE_FILE_OFFSET64] (F_GETLK, F_SETLK, F_SETLKW): Define to F_GETLK64,
F_SETLK64, F_SETLKW64, respectively.
* sysdeps/mach/hurd/fcntl.c (__libc_fcntl): TODO: F_GET/SETLK/W64 cases.
