    Fix _hurd_select for single fd sets
    
    The function attempts to optimize this case by performing one IPC system call
    with the timeout included among the parameters, but in the absence of a reply,
    it will call mach_msg again with the same timeout later, effectively doubling
    the total timeout of the select/poll call.
    
    Remove this optimization for the time being.
    
    * hurd/hurdselect.c (_hurd_select): Always call __io_select with no timeout.
