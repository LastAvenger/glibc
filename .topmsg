Subject: [PATCH] `recvmmsg`/`sendmmsg`

From id:"20120625233206.C000A2C06F@topped-with-meat.com", Roland McGrath: »They
are generally useful interfaces and there is nothing intrinsically Linuxoid
about them.  At least when not given a timeout, they could be implemented in
terms of sendmsg/recvmsg.  So perhaps we ought to have a sysdeps/posix
implementation that the Hurd would use instead of stubs (and folks can consider
adding new RPCs).  Then perhaps the Linux fallback case should be that instead
of stubs, too.«
