Subject: [PATCH] null pathnames shall return ENOENT

Here is a patch to fix chdir("") and chroot("") into returning ENOENT as
required by POSIX.

2009-09-13  Samuel Thibault  <samuel.thibault@ens-lyon.org>

        * hurd/hurdchdir.c (_hurd_change_directory_port_from_name):
        Return ENOENT when name is empty.
        * sysdeps/mach/hurd/chroot.c (chroot): Return ENOENT when path
        is empty.
