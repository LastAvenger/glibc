Subject: [PATCH] Fix setres[ug]id handling of -1

When passed -1, setres[ug]id are supposed not to change the existing
value.  The patch below does this the same way as setre[ug]id.

2011-10-17  Samuel Thibault  <samuel.thibault@ens-lyon.org>

* sysdeps/mach/hurd/setresgid.c (__setresgid): Handle the -1 case, which
shall preserve existing values.
* sysdeps/mach/hurd/setresuid.c (__setresuid): Likewise.
