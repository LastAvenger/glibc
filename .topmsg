Subject: [PATCH] hurdselect: remove dead code.

This removes code which actually never happens, and is already taken
care of in the function.

This is in the second part of select, when the __mach_msg() function
over the portset has returned something else than MACH_MSG_SUCCESS. I
guess in the past the value returned by __mach_msg() was stored in err,
so this code was necessary to set back err to 0, but now it is stored in
msgerr, so err is already still 0 by default. It can thus never contain
MACH_RCV_TIMED_OUT, i.e. the code is dead. The first case mentioned in
the comment is already handled: on time out with no message, err is
already still the default 0. On time out due to poll, err would still be
0, unless some of the io_select RPCs has returned EINTR, in which case
it contains EINTR. If any other io_select RPCs had returned a proper
answer, got!=0, and thus err is set to 0 just below. The code is thus
indeed not useful any more.

* hurd/hurdselect.c (_hurd_select): Remove unreachable check for
MACH_RCV_TIMED_OUT.
