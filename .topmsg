Subject: [PATCH] Fix F_*LK* fcntl with __USE_FILE_OFFSET64

struct flock64 uses 64bit values.  This introduces other values for F_GETLK,
F_SETLK, F_SETLKW to distinguish between both.

2014-08-31  Samuel Thibault  <samuel.thibault@ens-lyon.org>

        * sysdeps/mach/hurd/bits/fcntl.h (F_GETLK64, F_SETLK64, F_SETLKW64): New
        macros [__USE_FILE_OFFSET64] (F_GETLK, F_SETLK, F_SETLKW): Define to
        F_GETLK64, F_SETLK64, F_SETLKW64, respectively.
	* sysdeps/mach/hurd/flockconv.c: New file.
        * sysdeps/mach/hurd/fcntl.c (__libc_fcntl): Include "flockconv.c",
        handle F_GETLK64, F_SETLK64, F_SETLKW64 cases.
