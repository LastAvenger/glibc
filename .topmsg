Subject: [PATCH] init-first.c

init-first.c vs. GCC 4.1.

Needed for HEAD and glibc-2_7-branch.

For building with GCC 4.1 (and newer, most probably).

	* sysdeps/mach/hurd/i386/init-first.c: Undo parts of Roland's `r 1.43'
	to `r 1.44' changes.
	(_hurd_stack_setup): Take a ``void *'' argument.  Save the caller into
	CALLER and pass that one on.
	(init): Avoid an ugly typecast.
