Subject: hurdselect: Let select get interrupted by signals

We need to set MACH_RCV_INTERRUPT to avoid __mach_msg just looping on signals,
and then we can handle the interruption.

* hurd/hurdselect.c (_hurd_select): Pass MACH_RCV_INTERRUPT to
__mach_msg.  If that returns MACH_RCV_INTERRUPTED, set ERR to EINTR.
