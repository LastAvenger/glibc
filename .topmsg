Subject: [PATCH] Fix boot with statically-linked exec server.

* sysdeps/mach/hurd/i386/init-first.c (init): Also find ELF headers by oneself
when the pointer given in D is nul (as set by ext2fs).

Signed-off-by: Samuel Thibault <samuel.thibault@ens-lyon.org>

TODO: why is that actually needed? If exec being static is the problem,
that would happen with ext2fs.static too, but it doesn't...
