Subject: [PATCH] Fix mkdir / error value

(needed for busybox's mkdir -p)

In the / case, directory_name_split can't really split that into an
absolute ROOT file_t and ".", since name is supposed to be a pointer in
file_name... Changing the interface is being proposed.

	* sysdeps/mach/hurd/mkdir.c: Include <string.h>
	(__mkdir): When path is `/', just return EEXISTS.
	* sysdeps/mach/hurd/mkdirat.c: Include <string.h>
	(mkdirat): When path is `/', just return EEXISTS.
