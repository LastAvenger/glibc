Subject: [PATCH] getcontext, makecontext, setcontext, swapcontext

From: Thomas Schwinge <thomas@codesourcery.com>

Adapted from the Linux x86 functions.

Not thoroughly tested, but manual testing as well as glibc tests look fine, and
manual -lpthread testing also looks fine (within the given bounds for a new
stack to be used with makecontext).
