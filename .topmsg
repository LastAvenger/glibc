Subject: [PATCH] Hurd: Fix definition of `PAGE_COPY_THRESHOLD'

Previously, `PAGE_THRESHOLD' was defined instead of
`PAGE_COPY_THRESHOLD', preventing the optimization of memory copy
operations using `vm_copy'.

Also, increase the threshold to 4 pages.  XXX Tune this.

* sysdeps/mach/pagecopy.h (PAGE_THRESHOLD): Rename to `PAGE_COPY_THRESHOLD'.
Raise threshold to XXX pages.

---
This is however still WIP:

“
this currently doesn't make any difference since the
Makefile rules end up compiling sysdeps/i386/i586/memcpy{,_chk}.S,
i386/i586/memcopy.h, i386/memcopy.h instead...  Also, #if
PAGE_COPY_THRESHOLD doesn't like PAGE_COPY_THRESHOLD being
2*__vm_page_size, it ends up considering it false. Also, the rtld magic
in elf/ doesn't manage to determine that it also needs to include
wordcopy.os.
