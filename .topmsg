Subject: [PATCH] hurdsock: reject negative domains

Reject negative socket domains right away; otherwise, it is possible to read
and set out-of-bounds locations of the `servers' array (returning the values
at those invalid memory locations), and even try to deallocate ports with
random values if the `dead' parameter is different than zero.

        * hurd/hurdsock.c (_hurd_socket_server): Check for negative domains,
        and reject them.
