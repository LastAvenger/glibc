Subject: [PATCH] setitimer.c: Fix unlock in error patch

In some error path, setitimer_locked would not perform unlocking, here
is a patch.

2009-02-01  Samuel Thibault  <samuel.thibault@ens-lyon.org>

        * sysdeps/mach/hurd/setitimer.c (setitimer_locked): Use common exit path
        instead of returning without unlocking.
