Subject: [PATCH] The critical section lock _can_ be held in these place.

At least since hurd_thread_cancel can be called by another thread.

       * hurd/thread-cancel.c (hurd_thread_cancel): Do not assert that
       `&ss->critical_section_lock' is unlocked.
       * sysdeps/mach/hurd/jmp-unwind.c (_longjmp_unwind): Likewise.
       * sysdeps/mach/hurd/spawni.c (__spawni): Likewise.
