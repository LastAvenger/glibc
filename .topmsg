Subject: [PATCH] Fix connect/sendto/sendmsg into making sure to ignore bytes beyond sockaddr length

2014-03-01  Samuel Thibault  <samuel.thibault@ens-lyon.org>

Thanks Tanaka Akira for the report.

	* hurd/hurdsocket.h: New file, defines _hurd_sun_path_dupa which
	duplicates ADDR->sun_path with sockaddr LEN limitation.
	* sysdeps/mach/hurd/connect.c: Include <string.h>
	(__connect): Give result of _hurd_sun_path_dupa to name lookup.
	* sysdeps/mach/hurd/sendmsg.c: Likewise.
	* sysdeps/mach/hurd/sendto.c: Likewise.
	* sysdeps/mach/hurd/bind.c: Call _hurd_sun_path_dupa instead of
	implementing it by hand.
