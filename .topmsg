Subject: [PATCH] recvfrom(): take into account null address ports

Some kinds of sockets may return a null address port when calling the
`socket_recv' RPC, so avoid using it in case an address argument buffer is
asked to be filled.  In such case, set the length of that address buffer to
zero.

        * sysdeps/mach/hurd/recvfrom.c (__recvfrom): Check also for a null
        address port.  Set `addr_len' to 0 when not filling `addrarg'.
