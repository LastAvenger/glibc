Subject: [UNFINISHED] [PATCH] t/ld.so_auxv

Cf. 3a56ea26730755076cb5bc1d07727c7a4fcb8fd7

We don't get by with passing NULL as auxv to dl_main, because it will
unconditionally be dereferenced in elf/rtld.c.

Either conditionalize all use of auxv on HAVE_AUX_VECTOR, or make all code cope
with auxv == NULL.
