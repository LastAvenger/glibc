	* sysdeps/mach/hurd/i386/init-first.c (init): Use
	__builtin_frame_address instead of making assumptions about the
	location of the return address relative to DATA.  Force early load of
	the return address.
	(_dl_init_first, doinit1 in doinit in _hurd_stack_setup): Don't use
	__builtin_frame_address.
